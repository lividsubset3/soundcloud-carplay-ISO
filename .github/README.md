# Soundcloud CarPlay GUI
###### So the main reason behind this project is I saw it on a post a while back and though it was a great idea. And thinking someone already created it. I keep looking and I found nothing only theretical ideas. So, I though to my self, I wanted to work on project, and what a better time to teach my self on how to develop for Apple CarPlay.
